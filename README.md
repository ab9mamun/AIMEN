### Method
This AIMEN system empowers an ensemble of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) with Conditional Tabular GAN (CTGAN) to make better predictions. AIMEN also provides counterfactual explanations through the Nearest Instance Counterfactual Explanation (NICE) method.

Our paper investigates the effect of different restrictions and flexibilities on the data augmentation method. It discusses them in terms of prediction performance and the distribution gap between augmented and real data.

### Dataset
The original dataset is not available for public use at this point. We are considering publicly sharing some synthetic data of a similar format in the near future.
